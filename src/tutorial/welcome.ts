			<p>
			Welcome to the TScript tutorial! This tutorial is designed for
			programming beginners. Its main purpose is to teach you how to program a
			computer. Of course, it will do this using the TScript programming
			language. However, the general process is completely generic and
			transfers easily to other programming languages.
			</p>
			<p>
			The tutorial will guide you through a sequence of teaching units. Each
			unit is accompanied by programming tasks. This allows you to apply the
			newly gained knowledge hands-on.
			</p>
			<p>
			The tutorial consists of 20 units (this introduction included). As a
			beginner, you should not try to complete the whole tutorial at once.
			Instead, do a few units and then try the learned knowledge out using a
			pet project of your own. Once you start to feel comfortable with the
			material, you are ready to move on to the next challenge.
			</p>
			<p>
			You cannot learn to program in a day. Nobody can. Programming requires a
			certain way of thinking, and every new way of thinking takes some time
			to sink in. That's not specific to programming, it is true for most
			complicated things out there. Don't rush. Give it some time, and most
			importantly, practice a lot. On that way, this tutorial aims to be a
			good start.
